## Hi there 👋

**🙋‍♀️ A short introduction**

**ResourceIQ** is an intelligent developer allocation platform that replaces gut-feeling task assignment with data-driven recommendations. We integrate natively with Jira and GitHub to automatically profile developer skills from commits, PRs, and ticket history—then match tasks using a **70% skill fit + 30% workload balance** algorithm.

Our mission: Stop burnout. Surface hidden skills. Make task allocation fair and transparent.

**🌈 Contribution guidelines**

We're a team of 6 undergraduate researchers building this for our Software Development Group Project at IIT Sri Lanka & University of Westminster. While this is an academic project, we're open to:

- Bug reports & feature suggestions via Issues
- Feedback on our approach to ethical AI and bias mitigation
- Ideas from engineering managers and developers who face these problems daily

**👩‍💻 Useful resources**

- 📘 Project Documentation — Architecture, SRS, UML diagrams
- 📊 Research — Survey data, competitor analysis, NLP comparisons
- 🧠 ML Models — Jina Embeddings v3 + spaCy skill extraction
- 🔌 Integrations — Jira REST API v3, GitHub GraphQL API v4
- 📐 UI/UX — Next.js dashboard mockups and component library

**🍿 Fun facts**

- Our team surveyed 16 developers and found **83% have experienced burnout or boredom** from poor task assignment — that statistic became our north star.
- We chose Jina Embeddings because it understands code semantics, not just keywords. Yes, it can tell the difference between a React component and a React Native one.
- Two of us have personally been the "senior dev stuck fixing CSS while juniors drown in legacy code" — this project is personal.
- Our sprint retrospective board has more sticky notes than actual sticky notes.
